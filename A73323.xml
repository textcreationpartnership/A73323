            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135561:6"/> ſame. For <hi>correction</hi> is not ynough without <hi>direction,</hi> and <hi>reprehenſion</hi> is defectiue without <hi>inſtruction.</hi> A kinde <hi>Chiruigian</hi> will not onely diſcouer the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but apply the ſalue. A faithfull friend will not onely ſhew his friend his fault, or errour, but he will alſo giue his beſt aduiſe vnto him, that he might ſee to correct and preuent it for the time to come. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a true teacher is as well to teach the truth, as to confute and refell falſhoods: &amp; as he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and condemne euill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo ſhould he alſo be carefull to ſhew what is <hi>good</hi> &amp; how the euill may be preuented, &amp; amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. We count him a bad <hi>Guide,</hi> that onely tels the <hi>Trauellers</hi> of their wandring, and not of their way: and we iudge it the duty of a

                  <hi>to prooue our ſelues before wee come to the Lords Table,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wil here ſhew firſt, the reaſons why we ſhould make this triall: ſecondly, by what we ought to make it: thirdly, wherof it muſt be made: fourthly, how it ought
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135561:7"/> to be done. The reaſons that ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld mooue vs to make this triall are many.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, <hi>Let a man examine him-ſelfe.</hi> Now the will of GOD muſt bee the <hi>rule</hi> of our workes. What God biddeth, that muſt we bend our ſelues to do: And in his ſeruice wantes no ſolace. For as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (1. Cor. 7. 19.) <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is nothing, nor vncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of Gods commandements.</hi> And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture further ſaith (Reuel. 22. 14.) <hi>Bleſſed are they that doe his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their right may be in the tree of life, &amp; may enter in through the gates into the Citie:</hi> Now one of his Commandements is, that we <hi>doe examine</hi> our ſelues before we come to the <hi>Lords Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:135561:7"/>
               <p>Secondly, another argument may be borowed from the verſe next before going, and next enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may be thus framed.</p>
               <p>If he, that ſhall receiue this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>vnworthily,</hi> be <hi>guiltie</hi> of the body and blood of Chriſt, &amp; ſhall eate and drink his <hi>owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> then it behooueth euery man to ſearch and examine how he ſtands, and in what manner he commeth: <hi>this will all men graunt.</hi> But he that receiueth this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnworthily, is <hi>guiltie</hi> of the body and blood of Chriſt (a hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinne) and eates &amp; drinkes his <hi>owne damnation</hi> (a fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.) Therefore it behoueth all men to trye their ſtanding, and to examine in what plight they come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a wiſe man will not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135561:8"/> come to the banquet of an earthly Prince without ſome competent preparation; why then ſhould any man preſume to preſent himſelfe in the preſence of God and his Angels, and to come to the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of the great Prince of all the worlde, there to eate the fleſh and drink the blood of his <hi>onely Sonne,</hi> without due preparation, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelfe, which cannot be without this ſearch and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as preparatiues are neceſſarie before phiſicke for the body: ſo this examination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a way by Gods bleſſing for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> right receiuing of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred elements, as the phiſicke of our ſouls. For by it we ſhal knowe our eſtates, &amp; diſcerne our harts: by it we ſhall knowe how to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135561:8"/> diſcerne the Lords body: and we ſhall perceiue the <hi>loue of God</hi> in Chriſt vnto vs, who ordained this Sacrament for the confirmation of our faith; &amp; the <hi>moſt entire aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection of Chriſt</hi> vnto vs, in that he gaue him-ſelfe to a ſhamefull and curſed death to redeeme vs, being in bondage to <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and to <hi>Pharoah</hi> their King.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this examination will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in vs both thankfulnes, &amp; greater heede and watchfulnes. Thankfulnes I ſay; for after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if a man perceiue his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to be good, &amp; that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fitted and furniſhed in ſome competent meaſure, he is ſtirred vp to magnifye the Lord, who hath vouchſafed them this grace. If on the contrarye he finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135561:9"/> wretched or vnfit, he hath occaſion to praiſe the Lord, that gaue him grace to ſearch and ſee his condition, and that hee hath winked (as it were) at his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vnpreparednes, and hath not dealt with him, as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. And will it not alſo be an occaſion of greater heed and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy for the time to come? For euen as a man viewing and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering well by day, how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Bridge ouer ſome very deep water, he had ſafely paſſed in the darke, wilbe ſtrucken with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wilbe made more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thence-forward of his way; ſo when a man after examination of himſelfe, ſhall perceiue what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite danger by reaſon of his ſins, he hath eſcaped through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord, he ſhalbe prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135561:9"/> to admire the goodnes of God and to become more circumſpect in the time to come.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we are bound to ſearch and examine our ſelues at other times: &amp; in truth we ought to doe it daily; for we ſinne daily, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſiftes and ſhakes vs daily, and with the Sun we doe ſtill either aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend or deſcend, and with the ſalt waters continually either ebbe or flowe. Now if we ought to proue our ſelues at other times, how much more at this, when we are to conuerſe and deale, not with mortall man but with God, and that more neerely, and in a moſte ſpeciall and weightie buſineſſe? Men ſhould make the weightines of their affaires the <hi>rule</hi> of their care and labour.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, a man will not build an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135561:10"/> houſe, but he will examine and ſearch his ground to ſee whether it be firme or falſe, ſound or ſandy.</p>
               <p>There is no good huſband but will ſuruey his grounds, &amp; ſearch their nature: a faithful Shepheard will duely obſerue and ſearch his ſheep: an honeſt Lawyer will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine his Clients cauſe: and a skilful and carefull Surgeon will throughly ſearch his patients wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und: wherefore then ſhould not we exactly &amp; curiouſly ſearch and examine our ſelues, that we ruſh not without reaſon, vpon theſe holy myſteries? Hee that comes without this examination, may pertake of the type, but not of the truth: he may meet with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but he miſſeth the ſubſtance: Chriſt will not be eaten of thoſe that come with foule hands, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135561:10"/> filthy hearts: He wil not giue him ſelfe to them, that giue themſelues from him to ſerue ſin, &amp; Sathan, and their ſinful luſts. To conclude this firſt poynt; The wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to another, <hi>Cain</hi> (Gen. 45. 8. 9) was offended that God accepted not his offering: then he grewe in diſlike with his brother: after that he ſhewe him: after that he tolde God a lye, in ſaying that he knew not where his brother was: thence he fell to ſaucy language with the Lord, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> And after all this to diſpaire, <hi>My ſinne is greater then can be forgiuen.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Herod</hi> (Act. 12.) <hi>killed Iames,</hi> and clapt <hi>Peter vp in cloſe priſon,</hi> &amp; after this <hi>approued</hi> the wicked and atheiſticall <hi>acclamation and applauſe</hi> of the people, to Gods great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135561:11"/> Now if it be the marke of the wicked, thus to adde ſinne vnto ſinne, ought not Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to adde grace vnto grace, one good motion, &amp; one good worke vnto another? To deſire to come to the Lords Table is good in it ſelfe, and wil be alſo good in and vnto thee, if this thy good motion &amp; intent, thou ſecond with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke as good; by <hi>examining thy ſelfe,</hi> &amp; ſearching thy ſtate, and ſo preparing thy ſelfe vnto it. In a word, as no wiſe man will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any buſineſſe, vnleſſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himſelfe fit to goe through with it; ſo let no man heer aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled be ſo bolde as to meddle in theſe matters, vnles he finde and feele himſelfe in ſome good ſorte prepared, which no man can be without ſerious ſearch &amp; exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135561:11"/> of himſelfe: For as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cannot without ſearching of their bookes, knowe nor make a iuſt account of their debts and loanes, of their receipts &amp; expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of what they haue ſolde and bought; ſo is it impoſſible for vs without ſearch and examination of our ſelues to know our eſtates. Our memory is weake, &amp; our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight bad: our debts are many, our receipts are many, our accounts are great. We haue to anſwer for many cogitations &amp; many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, for many works, &amp; for many moe words. But when we come to this. Tryall, we ſhall finde it like <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>

                  <hi>ſworde,</hi> which found out the true mother of the childe. It may be God layes claime to thee, it may be Sathan alſo dooth the ſame: perhaps the Church challengeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135561:12"/> thee for hers, it may be the world doth ſo too: Thou canſt not be both theirs: they are not both thy father (at one time) nor both thy mother. But ſearch thine heart, and thou ſhalt perceiue by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and grace of God whoſe thou art, and to whome thou doſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. By tryall men finde out the nature of mettals: ſo by trying thy ſelfe, thou maieſt know the mettal whereof thou art made, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that hath moulten thee, &amp; the mould wherein thou waſt caſt: The huſband-man by ſearching his ground may come to knowe what is in it, and for what it is fit: ſo wee, by proouing &amp; ſearching the ground &amp; garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules, may knowe their quality, &amp; what growes in them moſt, whether the ſweet &amp; pleaſant flowers of Gods
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135561:12"/> graces, or the ſtinking weedes of ſinne. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe ſimilitudes theſe two points are illuſtrated; firſt that without examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſelues we cannot know our eſtates: now where this knowledge fayleth, there can be no due preparation for the comming to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and where <hi>due preparation</hi> is wanting, it were better to ſtay, then there to be. Secondly, hence appeareth, that by this examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may come to know our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, which is an excellent benefit, and a preparatiue to much good. A Captaine cannot be ſaid to haue prepared him-ſelfe to encounter with a ſtout and puiſſant Prince, vnles (beſides other dueties) he haue firſt <hi>tryed his owne ſtrength:</hi> ſo no man can be ſayd to haue fitted him-ſelfe for this holy buſines, till
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135561:13"/> he haue firſt <hi>examined himſelfe.</hi> And as euery ſicke perſon that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, perceiuing the daunger of <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pharoah</hi> no ſooner perceiued a <note place="margin">Exod. 8. 8, 28. &amp; 9, 28 &amp; 10, 17</note> plague, but he was by and by vpon <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would be a ſuter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for the remoouing of it. When <hi>Elymas</hi> was ſmitten blinde, that he could not ſee the <hi>Sun,</hi> he went about ſeeking ſome to leade him by the hand (Act. 13. 11.) and no doubt but deſired his eye-ſight with all his hearts; and ſhall not we when by this examination of our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135561:13"/> ſelues we finde the wretchednes of our ſtates, as that ſpirits of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, like thoſe Frogs of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> (Ex. 8. 3. 9.) haue crept into the chambers of our hearts, and that we are peſtered with whole ſwarmes of ſinnes, as the <hi>Aegipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were with ſwarmes of Flies &amp; Graſhoppers; that our ſoules are polluted with the botches &amp; bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of iniquitie, as their bodies were with ſcabs (Ex. 9. 10.) And that worſe then <hi>Elymas</hi> his blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, we are deſtitute of the eyes of our mindes, vnable to behold the <hi>Sun of righteouſnes,</hi> and to looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon &amp; let in the light of <hi>Gods loue:</hi> and finally that we are as blinde of minde, &amp; ignorant (as concerning true light, and ſauing knowledge) as <hi>Aegipt</hi> was blacke, when it was couered with darkenes, which

               <p>THe <hi>ſecond point</hi> to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is the thing, <hi>by which</hi> wee muſt examine our ſelues. For if the <hi>Maſon build</hi> by a wrong <hi>line,</hi> or the <hi>Carpenter cut</hi> by a wrong <hi>ſquire,</hi> their labour is but loſt, and their time conſumed: ſo if we try our ſelues by a falſe Touch-ſtone, and examine our eſtates by partial or vnfit iudges, wee ſhall delude our ſelues, &amp; deceiue our ſoules: we ſhall wrong our cauſe, and ſhal not ſee our caſe. Therefore eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take heede of theſe three that followe: trye not your ſelues by them, neither in their ſentence, nor example.</p>
               <p>The firſt is within thee, but not of thee, neither ouer thee, if thou
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135561:16"/> be Chriſtes, and if Chriſt bee in thee: and that is thy <hi>Fleſh,</hi> thy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſence,</hi> thy <hi>Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeekes for ſhelter in thy ſoule, and for harbour in thine heart, and therfore cannot indure that thou ſhouldeſt ſearch thy ſelfe, leaſt finding of her out, and perceiuing her noy ſomnes, thou ſhouldeſt either turne her out, as a ſaucie gueſt: or ſeeke to kill her as a ſecret foe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 1.) that thoſe which are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (as we al profeſſe our ſelues to be) doe <hi>not walke after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit:</hi> like men that are abſolued by the Iudge, and haue diſcharged what the lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, who do now no more walke in the priſon, but in the open ayre, and are no longer ruled by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135561:16"/> the Iaylor, but liue at liberty; yet perhapps ſauouring of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and carrying the prints of their Bolts and fetters, and not wholye ſtripped of their priſon garments.</p>
               <p>Now, if we be in Chriſt, as we ſay, and if wee either doe or (at leaſt) ought to walke after the ſpirit, and not after the fleſh or corruption of our hearts, what reaſon haue wee to make her our Iudge in the tryall of our ſtates?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee promiſed God in our Baptiſme that wee would forſake and deteſt the fleſh: but if wee make her our Iudge, wee ſhewe that we doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her, but fauour her, and that we doe not hate her but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harbour and hearten her.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:135561:17"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the wiſdome</hi> (euen the beſt part) <hi>of the fleſh is death,</hi> Ro. 8. 6. and therfore her ſentence can in no wiſe be iuſt and good. Who would meddle with that which is the cauſe of death, and make it his Iudge? and if the wiſdome of the fleſh be folly with the Lord, as ſure it is, then is the fleſh a verie foole, and makes thoſe fooliſh, that are ruled by her; therefore wicked men are tearmed fooles in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now, who would bee iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or examined by a foole, whoſe wiſedome is folly, yea and death; working death and deſtruction, to thoſe that ſubſcribe vnto it and will not renounce it?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 8. 5 That <hi>they that are after the fleſh, doe ſauour the things of the fleſh, but they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135561:17"/> that are after the ſpirit, the thinges of the ſpirit.</hi> But if wee will needes be tryed by the fleſh, and wilbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with her determination, we plainely demonſtrate that we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour not the thinges of the ſpirit, but that we are bewitched with the fleſh, and therefore that we are not guided by the holy Ghoſt but gouerned of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the very wiſedome of the fleſh, is not onely an enemie, <hi>but enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. wherefore doubtleſſe if the fleſh be our iudge, her ſentence will be againſt God, not for him, but moſt odious in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is no childe-like affection, nor property of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſonne, to reſt in her, who is a flat, fierce, and irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Seauenthly: the wiſedome of the fleſh <hi>is not ſubiect to the law of God, neither indeede can it be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. Now ſuch is the tree as are the fruites: the vviſedome of the fleſh is an vtter and moſt deſperat <hi>rebel</hi> againſt the law, therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the fleſh it ſelfe. For, <hi>for what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is thus or thus, that thing for which the thing is ſo, is it ſelfe much more ſo.</hi> Now if the fleſh rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law, and cannot be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it, vve muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is an vncompetent Iudge for vs; for it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it ſelfe, nor ſpeake wel for the law: it vvill not diſcouer her

               <p>Eightly, <hi>they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8. 8. But he that makes his <hi>fleſh</hi> his <hi>Iudge,</hi> or the <hi>Touchſtone</hi> to try himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and doth with full conſent of heart, ſubſcribe vnto her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and liue acording vnto her luſt, this man is in the fleſh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot pleaſe God. Now what true pleaſure can any man take, when God the fountaine of all true pleaſures, is not, nay can not be pleaſed? what pleaſure ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Man</hi> take to liue in that eſtate, wherin God the Lord of life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

If thou wouldeſt not be in the ranke and roll of thoſe, that can not pleaſe God, and doe not ſerue him, then make not thy fleſh thy Iudge, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe not to her ſentence, and liue not as ſhe luſteth.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the fleſh makes vs doe that we wold not, &amp; leaue vndon that we neither wold nor ſhould omit. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it a <hi>body of death,</hi> and cryeth out, <hi>O wretched man that I am I who ſhall deliuer mee</hi>

               <p>Tenthly, <hi>The fleſh lucteth againſt the ſpirit,</hi> or the illumined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part of man: <hi>and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the fleſh: and theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another. Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Firſt, it is ſaide to luſt or ſtriue againſt the ſpiritul part of a man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the holy ſpirit; like two mortall and implacable enemies, and this conflict is without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time: ſo long as they liue together, ſo long they doe one luſt againſt another, onelye death doth end the combate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a full and finall deſtruction of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall wee take part with our fleſh againſt our ſpirit? with the worke of Sathan againſt the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135561:22"/> work of God? This wee ſhall do if wee chuſe her for our Iudge, and liſten to her voice, who like a <hi>Gnat</hi> begins with ſinging, and endes with ſtinging, ſoothing vs vp with her <hi>Syrenian</hi> ſongs, but ſeeking indeede to deſtroy our ſoules, and to quel the Graces of God within vs: yea, rather as the Lord promiſed his people <hi>(Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> 23. 30) to driue their enemies out of their land by little &amp; little, ſo we ought to deſire his Maieſtie to conſume and to driue out this euemy out of our hearts.</p>
               <p>And as the Iſraelites were in expreſſe tearmes forbidden to make any couenant with thoſe their enemies (verſe 32.) ſo wee muſt make no couenant with our fleſh, no contract; no peace at al, neither of amitie nor of concord,

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>theſe are contrarie one to another,</hi> as fire to water, and light to darkeneſſe: and yet mixed together in one man, as heate and colde in luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme water.</p>
               <p>If now the corruption of our hearts (the fleſh) bee flat contrary to the worke of grace, within vs, created in vs by the holy Ghoſt, it were greate impietie for vs to ſhew the leaſt fauour vnto it, how much more wicked were it to ſet it on the <hi>Bench,</hi> and to lend our eares vnto it?

All which are <hi>Make-bates</hi> betwixt God and man, and are ful of peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilent &amp; pernicious effects; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnfit to make the fleſh our Iudge. For vndoubtedly, ſhe will not condemne her owne
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135561:23"/> workes, neither can ſhe indure to ſee them diſpiſed &amp; forſaken. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, conſidering that her fruits are very poiſon to them that taſte them, we ought rather to labour that ſhe may be ſtubbed vp, then to ſhade our ſelues vnder her bowes or to ſhewe her the leaſt grace or ſmalleſt curteſie. Laſtly, <hi>they that are Chriſts, haue crucified the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>fleſh with the affections and the luſts.</hi> We do all profeſſe our ſelues to be Chriſtes: but if we make the fleſh our Iudge and follow her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we ſhall not crucifye the fleſh, but rather indeed take her from the croſſe, and put life and ſpirit into her, yea and promote her highly. For to be a <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Counſellour,</hi> is a ſtate of dignitie and honor: and if we followe her fancie, and do as ſhe preſcribeth,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135561:24"/> we plainely ſhew that we are not Chriſts, but hers: not his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but her ſlaues: Neither haue we crucified her luſts: If we will needes be ruled by her, &amp; ſet her vp for a Iudge in the triall of our ſtates. For it is her deſire that we ſhould ſo do, and it is her worke, if we either <hi>will</hi> ſo, or <hi>worke</hi> ſo.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue heard many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we ſhould not try our ſelues, and examine our eſtates by our <hi>fleſh:</hi> againſt whome I haue much contended, becauſe very many are carried headlong by her into a gulfe of ſecuritie, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering themſelues, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their conditions good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe the lawes can take no hold vpon them, being in the meane while moſt miſerable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of true faith, and the filiall

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135561:28"/> that the receiuers worſhip they knowe not what, being ignorant of the Prieſts intention, whoſe minde may wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der from his work, though his tongue be on it. 3. That the bread and wine by vertue of the words of conſecration, are truely turned into the very body and blood of Chriſt. 4. That the true and ſubſtantiall body of Chriſt, is truely receiued and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>All</hi> the Communicants, though prophane and vnbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: Indeed they confeſſe that they doe themſelues hurt therby. 5. That this Sacrament is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored with deuine worſhip, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is ſeene. 6. That Chriſt in his owne perſon doth offer vp himſelfe by the Prieſt, to God the Father, a true, real, and external ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſinnes, truely and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135561:29"/> properly, and that vnder the formes of bread and wine, but yet after an vnbloody manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning faith, ſhe teacheth that it is no confidence in Gods mercy, or ſpeciall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſts merrits to a mans heart in particular, but a meere and pure aſſent vnto the word of God. 2. That no man can in this life be certein of the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſinnes, by the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith, but onely by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturall perſwaſion. 3. That true iuſtifiing faith may be loſt totally and for euer. 4. That it is proud preſumption in a man to ſay that he is certaine of preſent grace &amp; future glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as touching repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhe teacheth, 1. That it is a ſacrament of the new teſtament
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135561:29"/> 2. That co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition is a meritorious cauſe of the pardon of ſins. And for ſinne it ſelfe ſhe teacheth. 1. That originall ſin after Baptiſme is ſo aboliſhed, that it neither hath the nature, nor may properly haue the name of ſin; being now but as tinder, apt to receiue the fire of ſinne, or as a puniſhment of ſinne. 2. That ſome ſinnes (mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall indeed) are in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture venial, and being not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the lawe and loue of God, &amp; that they are not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, concerning the workes of obedience and loue, ſhe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth 1. That the works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men do merrit eternall life, in reſpect of their owne dignity. 2. That works of men iuſtified, do deſerue increaſe of grace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135561:30"/> righteouſnes. 3. That almes done without loue haue power to prepare vs to our Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but being done in faith and loue, are truely ſatisfactory before God. In a word, her chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt champion (and now a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) affirmeth that the confeſſion of ſinnes, made by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in the Prieſts eare, and the <hi>Priests abſolution,</hi> is their onely lawfull probation of themſelues, or praeparation which they ought to make, that they may be fit recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers.

In this life, in the body to diſeaſes, in his goods to loſſes, in his good name to ignominie; in the end of his life to death, which hauing cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the threed of life, &amp; made a deuorce between the ſoule and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135561:38"/> body, doth immediately ſet open Hell gate for his ſoule to enter in.

Thirdly, for the ſtate of Grace, we muſt firſt know that we are redeemed from this miſery <hi>onely</hi> by Chriſt, who fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the law for vs, &amp; by his death hath defaced death, and ſin the <hi>ſting</hi> of death, and ſatisfied for all our ſins to the full.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt know that we are regenerated by the Holy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135561:38"/> Ghoſt, who is therfore called the <hi>Spirit of ſanctification</hi> or <hi>holines.</hi> It is he that by the fire of his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">

The <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of this Sacrament, whereof it doth conſiſt, is two-fold, one <hi>earthly,</hi> outward and viſible: the other is <hi>heauenly,</hi> inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. That is commonly called the <hi>ſigne,</hi> and this the thing <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> By the <hi>ſigne</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both the <hi>element</hi> or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubſtance ſeene with the eyes, &amp; alſo the <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>rites</hi> vſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deuine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elementary</hi> ſignes in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament are two, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which two make but <hi>one</hi> ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for they do declare but <hi>one</hi> action of Chriſt, to wit, our <hi>whole</hi> ſpirituall nouriſhment: and we know that in <hi>one</hi> feaſt there may diuers diſhes &amp; varietie of drinks
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135561:42"/> be vſed. One man hath two parts; one body many members; &amp; one tree ſundry bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches: moreouer, that is not onely ſaid to be one, which is ſimple &amp; indiuiſible, or continued, but that alſo which is <hi>perfect.</hi> Now this ſacrament is <hi>one</hi> as touching <hi>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> in aſ much as by thoſe two ſignes our perfect foode or reliefe is ſignified and ſealed to vs. Moe ſignes need not, becauſe theſe are ſufficient to ſhew perfect refection: and again if one were wanting, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>perfect</hi> nouriſhment were maimed &amp; defaced. It is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry dinner where there is no meat, and a dry feaſt where there is no drinke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Actions</hi> vſed in the <hi>lawfull</hi> adminiſtration of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are of two ſorts: ſome are of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135561:42"/> the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Receiuer,</hi> and all ſignificant and liuely: The action of the Miniſter is foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: the firſt is his <hi>taking</hi> of the bread and wine into his owne hands. The ſecond is his <hi>bleſsing</hi> of them. The third is the <hi>breaking</hi> of the bread and <hi>powring</hi> out of the wine. The fourth is <hi>deſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>The action of the <hi>Receiuer</hi> is two-fold. The firſt is his <hi>taking</hi> of the bread and wine of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the ſecond is the <hi>eating</hi> of the bread and <hi>drinking</hi> of the wine: &amp; thus much for the ſigne. The thing <hi>ſignified</hi> is that which is meant by the ſigne, and it is two-fold: the former anſwering to the corporall and elementary ſignes: the latter anſwering to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid actions. Of the firſt ſort are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135561:43"/> the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the bread and wine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we exclude his whole perſon, for neither the deuinitie without the humanitie; nor the humanitie without the deuinitie can performe the worke of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation. But becauſe he ſuffered only in his humane nature, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is only expreſly reſembled; though <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt and <hi>all</hi> his merrits muſt be vnderſtood and not excluded: For the merrit and efficacy of his death floweth from his deity, &amp; from the dignitie of his perſon, as from their proper fountaine. And the ſcriptures by the death of Chriſt do ſometimes meane by a figure his whole obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience actiue and paſſiue, and the benefits that ariſe from the ſame. The ſecond kinde of things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135561:43"/> are thoſe things which are reſembled by thoſe actions of the Miniſter, and communicants.</p>
               <p>According to the foure-folde actions of the Miniſter, foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges are ſignified.</p>
               <p>Firſt his <hi>taking</hi> the bread and wine into his hands, doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an action of God the father, by which he did from all eternity <hi>ſeperate</hi> and elect his ſonne to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the office of a Mediatour betwixt God and man.</p>
               <p>Secondly his <hi>bleſſing</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherebe he doth prepare, deſtinate and ſanctifie them to be a ſacrament of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, doth ſignifie a ſecond action of the father, by which he did in the fulneſſe of time <hi>ſend</hi> his ſon to <hi>execute</hi> the office of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, vnto which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135561:44"/> ordained. Thirdly the <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of the bread and <hi>powring</hi> of the wine, doth ſignifie the bitter <hi>paſſion</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>piercing</hi> of his body, and the ſhedding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his blood, and the <hi>rending</hi> (as it were) of his ſoule for our ſins: for <hi>(as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and broken for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:</hi> he was <hi>plagued</hi> for our wickednes. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 5. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, his <hi>deſtributing</hi> of the bread and wine vnto the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants ſignifieth an action of the Father, <hi>offering</hi> his Sonne to all, but giuing him only to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. To proceede; according to the two-folde action of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,</hi> two things are reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Firſt the <hi>receiuing</hi> of the bread and wine, ſignifieth a ſpirituall action of the receiuer; to wit, his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135561:44"/> 
                  <hi>receiuing</hi> of Chriſt by the hand of faith. Secondly their eating and drinking of them, ſignifieth and ſealeth their <hi>application</hi> of Chriſt to their hearts by faith, or their <hi>inward and ſpiritual eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of his body and blood, and <hi>feeding</hi> vpon him (as vppon a moſt delicate and wholeſome diſh) for the nouriſhment of their ſoules: For as there are two parts of man, body and ſoule; ſo there are two ſorts of feeding; the one outward or ſacramentall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward or ſpirituall: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ordained of Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and expreſſe this latter. So much of the <hi>material</hi> cauſe of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The internal and proper forme thereof, is the <hi>relatiue &amp; ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall coniunction</hi> of the ſignes and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135561:45"/> things ſignified, whereby they are made <hi>one,</hi> in reſpect of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, proportion, &amp; a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal relation and affinity one with another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>end</hi> of this ſacrament is manifold. 1. That the death of Chriſt may be reteined in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, 1. Cor. 11. 24. 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. <hi>Do this</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> By which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth firſt, Chriſts <hi>loue</hi> vnto vs; for the property of loue is to make the louer deſire to liue in their memories whome he doth loue: ſecondly his faithfull <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi> is hereby cleared, in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that his benefit conferred might truly profit vs: for as by forgetting, benefits are loſt: ſo by remembring of them they are conſerued.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:135561:45"/>
               <p>2. That God might viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his inuiſible guifts to our outward ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, our ſight, taſte &amp; touch, that the whole man being ſtirred vp both in ſoule &amp; body, might with great chearefulnes &amp; ioy celebrate this ſacred and ſumptuous banquet.</p>
               <p>3. That it might be a ſigne, ſeale and confirmation of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, coniunction and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with Chriſt our head, and by him with the father and holy ſpirit. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6, 56.</p>
               <p>4. To ſignifie and ſeale vnto vs our ſpirituall feeding vpon, and foode by Chriſt: <hi>prouided</hi> that we come prepared. For as meat or medicines for the body are not onely vnprofitable but alſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if they be not taken as they ſhould: euen ſo it is with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135561:46"/> of the Lord, a meat or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the ſoule; if it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right receiued, we harme our ſelues.</p>
               <p>5. That it might be a token and ſeale of the new teſtament or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant betweene God and vs, wherein God doth teſtifie that he doth receiue vs to fauor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our faults for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſt, and for the merrit of his death, liuely ſet forth and ſhadowed by this ſacrament.</p>
               <p>6. To ſignifie and ſeale vnto vs the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſoule from ſin, &amp; the bodie from the graue.</p>
               <p>7. That it might be a token and <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 54</note> pledge of our communion one with another. We all eat of one bread, and drinke, of one cup or drinke; as fellowes in one family, and ſeruants of one Lord.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:135561:46"/>
               <p>8. That it might be a publike te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our profeſſion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from pagans and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the nature of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: theſe things we ought all to know: and we ought to prooue our ſelues before we do receiue, whether wee doe know theſe things, or the ſubſtance of them yea or no. If not; we muſt vſe meanes to get this knowledge leaſt we come vnprepared, and ſo prouoke the Lord againſt vs: thus much for the <hi>first</hi> thing whereof we muſt examine ourſelues.</p>

For <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>eye</hi> whereby we looke vppon Chriſt hanging vppon the croſſe, who is that bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſerpent, which cureth our ſoules, in ridding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſtings of ſin, &amp; of the poyſon of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Satan. Faith</hi> is the <hi>hand</hi> which apprehendeth Chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>mouth</hi> which receiues him, the <hi>tongue</hi> that taſts him, the <hi>teeth</hi> that chew him, the <hi>throate</hi> that ſwalloweth him, and the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke</hi> which digeſts him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135561:47"/> it muſt in no caſe be wanting in thoſe, that intend to receiue the Sacrament. Now as a tree may be knowne by her fruits, ſo may faith be diſcerned by the fruits and ſignes thereof. He that goeth vp the riuer may in time come to the ſpring: and he, that followeth the heat, may ſoone perceiue where the fire is. There are three infallible tokens of true faith, that I may not number ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The firſt is <hi>Loue,</hi> which as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth 1. <hi>Timot.</hi> 1. 5.) proceeds from <hi>faith vnfaigned.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>Feare:</hi> for if a man be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God doth loue him, and that Chriſt was crucified for his ſinnes, he wilbe afraid to diſpleaſe them by his ſinnes, and will ſtand in a reuerentawe. The third is a vehement and conſtant deſire to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135561:48"/> haue perfect fellowſhip with, and a full fruition and ſight of God, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt. VVhen a man ſhall vnderſtand that ſome great Prince did ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, as that he gaue his only ſonne to death, to ſaue him from death, and that he continueth in his affection ſtil vnto him; he wil long to ſee him, and will willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow himſelf vpon him that he might inioy his preſence, and haue continuall conuerſation and company with him; he doth ſo co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135561:48"/> him, and that the Holy Ghoſt doth regenerate and ſanctifie him, flinging the gates of Hell from off their hinges within him, and refining his ſoule from the droſſe of ſinne, and printing a freſh the image of God within him; he can not but ſincerely and inceſſantly deſire the ſocietie of this bleſſed Trinitie: He cannot but e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe fourth, concerneth the <hi>manner</hi> how this examination ſhould be made. For the manner of working doth helpe much to the making or the marring of the worke. God requires that all our worke ſhould be both <hi>good</hi> and <note place="margin">Bonae. Baenc.</note> 
                  <hi>well</hi> wrought. An action good in it ſelfe may be <hi>euill</hi> in the agent, &amp; indeed is, vnles it be <hi>well</hi> acted. A good worke ill wrought, a good deede ill done, a good word <hi>ill</hi> vttered, a good ſpeach <hi>ill</hi> ſpoken,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135561:59"/> is no better at the beſtthen <hi>(Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didum peccatum)</hi> a <hi>beautifull</hi> ſin; like a tree without pith, like a bone without marow, a body without a ſoule. Firſt therefore, this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination muſt be made in <hi>faith,</hi> for <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 14. 23</note> But we haue warrant ſufficient out of the word for this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo that in performing of it, we conteine our ſelues within the compaſſe of the worde, and take direction from thence for right performance of it. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we ought to belieue aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God will for the ſake of Chriſt accept of our examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will winke at the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it, Or at leaſt we ought to belieue that God can pardon our weakenes in the doing of it, and to deſire with all our hearts
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135561:60"/> that the weakenes may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and the worke approoued. Secondly we ought to examine our ſelues in conſcience of Gods commaundment, euen becauſe God would haue vs to do it. <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better then Sacrifice, and to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15 22</note> 
                  <hi>hearken is better then the fat of Rams.</hi> Now the beſt obedience is, when the perſon that obeies, performes the worke commaunded in the way of obedience, that is with an intent and purpoſe to obey the perſon that doth commaund it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly our examination muſt be made in truth; truely, not fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, or in ſhew onely. Our minde muſt be vpon it, we ſhould haue a heart to examine our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. Sincerity is as <hi>Salt</hi> to ſeaſon an action, and to make it ſauory: it is the <hi>ax-tree</hi> whereon it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135561:60"/> and the wheele whereon it runneth. A worke wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſincerity is like a ſcul without braines, or to a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, faire without but foule within. There is none more vilde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an hypocrite, his heart is falſe, his puniſhment horrible, and his hypocriſie moſt abhominable. His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience accuſeth him, God doth accurſe him, and man doth abhorre him. Let vs therefore in all our actions beware of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. <hi>Peter</hi> would haue all the faithfull to lay downe <hi>all deceit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Pete. 2. 1</note> 
                  <hi>and hypocriſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, our examination muſt be made in <hi>loue</hi> to God, and in <hi>feare</hi> of his dreadfull name. The childe worketh vpon his fathers commaundment, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his father and feareth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135561:61"/> him. So we, that profeſſe our ſelues to be the children of God, muſt do this duety heere inioyned, becauſe we loue God, and becauſe he ſheweth his loue to vs, and becauſe we are afraid to offend him by our diſobedience heerein; as being vnwilling to looſe his loue or loue-tokens, or to venture his diſpleaſure, and ſo to kindle the coales of his wrath againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we muſt proue ourſelues <hi>throughly:</hi> our tryall muſt be <hi>ſtrict</hi> and our ſearch <hi>narrow:</hi> we muſt ſo proue, as that we may <hi>approue</hi> our ſelues, which cannot be by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſuperficiall examination. <hi>The heart is deceiptfull and wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bóue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ieri. 17. 9</note> 
                  <hi>all things, who can know it?</hi> Sin is ſo ſmooth, our fleſh is ſo falſe, Sathan is ſo ſubtill, and we ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135561:61"/> ſimple and ſo ſilly, that vnleſſe we ſearch our ſelues to the quicke &amp; examine narowly, we ſhall neuer truely diſcerne our eſtates. Mettal lyeth in the bowels of the earth, &amp; ſin in the bowels of the ſoule; a man muſt dig deep that meanes to finde it out. We muſt <hi>be wiſe as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16</note> 
                  <hi>Serpents:</hi> but it is a maine poynt of wiſedome to try throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we truſt, to prooue well and warily before we do approoue: we muſt turne <hi>throughly</hi> from all our ſinnes, we muſt turne out of all our ſinful waies; it is therefore neceſſary that we ſhould examin our ſelues <hi>throughly:</hi> we muſt <hi>keepe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 4. 23</note> 
                  <hi>our hearts with all dilligence,</hi> ſo we muſt examine them with <hi>all dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi> Iob ſaith, that <hi>when he knew not the cauſe he ſought it out dilligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Iob 29. 16, So, that we may ſee
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135561:62"/> our caſe and know our ſelues, let vs examine our ſelues dilligently with all care and conſcience. When a Magiſtrate examines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter or any man looſely and but ſuperficially, it is by reaſon of ignorance, negligence, or partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: ſo we ſhall bewray one of thoſe euils in vs, if we do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and throughly try our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and examine our ſelues. Thus we ſee how we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelues. As Chriſt ſaith <hi>Take heed how ye heare:</hi> ſo I ſay take heede how ye examine. There is <note place="margin">Luke 8. 18</note> an ill manner of hearing, and an ill manner of examining: he that will examine and try himſelfe <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> muſt not onely try by the <hi>right</hi> touch-ſtone, but in the <hi>right</hi> faſhion. It wil not be here amiſſe to declare alſo the end why we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135561:62"/> muſt prooue our ſelues. The end is two-folde, principall &amp; inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The <hi>principall</hi> end is the <hi>glory of God,</hi> which ought aboue all things to be ſought for of all men in all their actions, therfore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (1. Cor. 10. 31) <hi>Whether ye eat or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> The <hi>inferiour</hi> end is two-folde: Firſt that we might know our ſelues and the caſe we are in, that ſo we might prepare our ſelues for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Lords ſupper. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might confirme the good aſſurance or perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we haue of our good eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, For <hi>true</hi> &amp; <hi>new</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the commaundments of God, doth plainely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the obeier is the childe of God, the member of Chriſt,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135561:63"/> within the kingdome of grace, and an heir apparent of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. But obedience performed to this one comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of examination in the <hi>right manner,</hi> which I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>new</hi> obedience, &amp; is in him onely that is carefull to obſerue <hi>all other</hi> commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he knoweth to be Gods. Therefore he that obeieth this one precept as he ought to do, may aſſure himſelfe that his ſtate is <hi>good before God</hi> in this world, and ſhalbe <hi>glorious with God</hi> in the world to come. And ſo much for the fourth generall point &amp; for the doctrine it ſelfe. The vſes thereof come now to be deliuered.</p>

Now that wee wee may approoue our ſelues rightly, wee muſt labour that all our works be according to Gods will, performed with an honeſt heart in the name of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorie of God.

               <p>Let vs therefore (brethren) not onely prooue, but alſo approoue our ſelues.

               <p>Firſt, it is taken for bread pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. And <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech brought foorth bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Thirdly, it is put for <hi>Manna, Ex.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>And in the morning yee
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135561:81"/> ſhalbe filled with bread,</hi> that is, with <hi>Manna,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth expound it in the fifteene verſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it ſignifieth ſacrifices, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Ye offer vncleane bread vpon mine Alter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is taken generally for all things neceſſarie for the maintenance of this preſent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life. And ſo it is vſed in the Lords prayer, and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate thy bread;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt get thy liuing.</p>
               <p>In this place it is vſed in his proper and naturall ſignification. Now our ſauiour ordained bread to be the Sacrament of his body, by reaſon of the analogie and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the properties and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſigne, and the thing ſignified.

               <p>Firſt, as corporall bread is made of corne, ſo ſpirituall bread is made of the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as bread is baked in the ouen with the heat of the fire: euen ſo the body of Chriſt was (as it were) baked with the fire of the Croſſe, and prepared to bee the foode of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as bread aſſwageth hunger, and ſtrengtheneth the heart, and preſeruet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the life of the body: ſo the merits of Chriſts body ſtayeth the hunger of the ſoule, and ſtrengthneth it to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as bread profiteth the hungrye, and not thoſe that are full: ſo the merit of Chriſts body doth benefit thoſe only, that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after righteouſnes, but thoſe neuer a whit, which ſwell with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:135561:82"/> the opinion of their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and perfect puritie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as bread diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many is a token of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: ſo alſo the body of Chriſt ſacrificed for the ſinnes of many, is a token and pledge of his good will towards vs, and of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good amongſt our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, as one &amp; the ſame bread is made of many graines: ſo wee many, who pertake of one bread, (one in a common notion of the Sacrament, and receiued to one ende, but not one in number) are one myſticall body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And it pleaſed him to make choyce of bread rather then of fleſh, becauſe he did not reſpect the colour or externall forme (in which regard fleſh is likeſt to fleſh) but the ſtrength or vertue
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:135561:83"/> to releiue and nouriſh, which is greater in bread (the ſtaffe of life) then in the fleſh of any creature whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Cup,</hi> the Apoſtle vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the <hi>wine</hi> in the cup. Now Chriſt inſtituted wine to bee the ſigne of his blood for the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, that is between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and effects of wine and his blood. For;</p>
               <p>Firſt, as wine is a moſt ſweete liquor comming out of the vine: ſo the blood of Chriſt is a moſt delicate drinke for the ſoule: hee is the <hi>Vine</hi> from whence it came, <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 1.</note> and the <hi>Grape</hi> ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, as wine ſlaketh the thirſt of the body: ſo the merite of Chriſts blood quencheth the thirſt of the ſoule.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:135561:83"/>
               <p>Thirdly, as wine maketh the <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 15.</note> heart merrie, ſo the blood of Chriſt receiued by faith doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſoule, and maketh the heart ioyfull.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as wine warmeth the body and driueth away cold: ſo the blood of Chriſt expelleth the coldneſſe of charitie, and heateth our hearts with zeale and loue.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as Wine cauſeth the countenance to ſhine, &amp; remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth paleneſſe: ſo the merite of Chriſtes blood taketh away the paleneſſe of the ſoule, and makes it looke freſh and faire as a roſe.

               <p>FIrſt, I conclude out of theſe wordes of PAVL, that they, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:135561:88"/> of this concluſion, wee haue firſt (beſides this) other expreſſe phraſes of Scripture: ſecondly, other arguments grounded vpon the word, and vpon good reaſon: thirdly, the iudgement of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue</hi> Church for many hundred yeares together after Chriſt.</p>

Here is not a word of any <hi>tranſubſtantiating,</hi> or turning the bread and wine, into the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and true body and blood of our Lord, but a plaine diſtinction made betwixt the ſignes and the things ſignified without annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or corporall alteration.

For firſt, it were very abſurde to imagine, that Chriſt did eate his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:135561:89"/> and therefore alſo as abſurde to ſay that the diſciples did eate it. <note place="margin">Now the bread is his ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodie, that is, the Sacrament, the ſigne and ſeale this bodie: and the word (I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) is as much as <hi>ſignifieth</hi> as in <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 21.</note> For he and they did eat of one thing. Secondly, there are other places of the Scripture like vnto this, which ſhew that his ſpeech was not proper, but figuratiue: and it is ſtrange that they, which ſtand ſo much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> figures, could perceiue none heere. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Circumciſion is the Couenant,</hi> that is, a <hi>ſigne</hi> of the couenant. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12. 11. The <hi>Lambe is the Lordes Paſſeouer,</hi> that is, a <hi>ſigne</hi> and <hi>pledge</hi> thereof. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>The rocke was Chriſt,</hi> that is, a <hi>ſigne</hi> of Chriſt. Thirdly, wee muſt needes vnderſtand a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the word <hi>Cup:</hi> and a figure is granted of all, euen of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of this doctrine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſhould it ſound againſt reaſon to hold that ſpeech to bee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:135561:89"/> vnderſtood by a figure?</p>
               <p>For the ſecond: It is againſt common ſenſe, that Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which is finite and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible, ſhould bee in ſo many places together ſo farre diſtant one from an other: and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents ſhould remaine without a ſubject, as if the whiteneſſe of the ſnow ſhould continue, when the ſnow it ſelfe is melted. It is true indeed that the power of God is great: but yet hee neither doth, nor wil doe, whatſoeuer he is able by his power for to doe. He can of ſtones make children vnto <hi>Abraham:</hi> hee can conſume the world at one inſtant, but hee doth not, neither will doe. And againe: there are ſome things which God cannot doe. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, he cannot deny himſelfe.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:135561:90"/> hee cannot breake his promiſe, and goe againſt his word. Hee hath ſaid that the <hi>heauen muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt, till the time that al thngs be reſtored:</hi> therefore he ſhall bee there aboue, &amp; is not here below. Yea further, God cannot make one thing to be, &amp; not to be at one inſtant. He cannot make the aire to be wholly both fire and water at one moment. God cannot make the body of Chriſt to bee both a true bodie, and not a true bodie, circumſcribed &amp; not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed to haue dimenſions, and to bee without dimenſions: to bee in heauen, and vpon the earth alſo in a thouſand diſtinct places at one and the ſame Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of time, and to be as long, as broad, and as thicke in a peece of bread as it was, when it hanged
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135561:90"/> vpon the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee beleeue that Chriſtes bodie was conceiued in the wombe of the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> therefore ſure it is not made of Bakers bread.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requireth that there ſhould be an outward, viſible, and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi> ſigne, as well as an inward, and ſpirituall thing ſignified: but the doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ouerthrow the ſigne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if wee allow of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, wee ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the body, that was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death for vs: but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, which an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not a bodie, but plaine bread.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when a <hi>Mouſe</hi> eateth hallowed bread, what eates ſhe?
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:135561:91"/> doth ſhee eate the ſhadow, the ſhape and likeneſſe of bread? For thoſe <hi>Alchimiſts</hi> hold, that the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the bread is gone. Now it were abſurd to ſay, that a <hi>mouſe</hi> could feed vpon naked accidents or mere colours. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ſhe eate? the body of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> How abſurde and impious were it to imagine? It remaineth therefore that the ſubſtance of the bread doth ſtill continue. If the bread after Conſecration bee burnt to aſhes, and the wine caſt into the fire, whence come the aſhes? And whence is the ſmoke &amp; hiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing? Surely they cannot come of mere accidents, as ſhape, colour, dimenſions, &amp;c. Therefore it is ſafeſt to hold the continuance of the Elements, as touching their ſubſtance. For the third, we haue

For to ſay otherwiſe, were as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſay, that the redneſſe of the face
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:135561:93"/> can continue, when the face is quite defaced and conſumed: or that the colours of the rainbow may remaine, when the cloud is vaniſhed &amp; diſſolued. It may bee then dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, why chriſt ſhould rather ſay, <hi>This is my body,</hi> then <hi>this</hi> (that is, <hi>this bread) ſignifieth my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi> I anſwere, that hee vſed that ſpeech, becauſe it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to declare more expreſly, that the breàd is not ſet before vs to be conſidered as it is in it ſelfe; that is, as it is bread, but that wee ought to behold and lay hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that with the eye &amp; hand of a liuely faith, which is repreſented &amp; ſignified by the bread, as if the bread were not the ſigne thereof, but the thing it ſelfe, which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it.</p>

In one word, hee is preſent in reſpect of our faith, which ioyneth things that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:135561:94"/> are far diſtant in place one from another. We do not therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the reall and true preſence of Chriſt, but wee doe onely denie that hee is preſent in a bodily manner.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of theſe things, ſerueth to condemne the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which teacheth that the elements after the words of conſecration are truely turned into the body and blood of Chriſt: ſo, as that nothing remaineth of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all, ſauing nak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And according to this her doctrine ſhe ſquareth out her practiſe; perſecuting with fire and fagot, with ſword and word, thoſe that will not ſubſcribe vnto it: and yet there is no footing for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:135561:95"/> it in the word of God; not one ſentence nor ſyllable, which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds or fauours it.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore deteſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe it, and let vs deſire the Lord of his mercie to open their eyes that hold it, daily increaſing the number of true Chriſtians, and weakening the kingdome of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> that the <hi>Goſpell</hi> may flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and that the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may bee enlarged to the conſolation of the faithfull; and glory of God; vnto whom, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be rendered all honor, laud and power, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and euer.
